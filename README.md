# ducky-generator
This python script generates ducky scripts ([Rubber Ducky by Hak5](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky)) which can be used to brute-force numberic passwords.
This should work with Flipper Zeros, and USB Rubber Duckies.

steps:
1. Run the program (ducky.py)
2. When asked for the length of the password, enter the length of the numeric password you want to brute force.
3. Done! Your ducky script should be saved to a file.
